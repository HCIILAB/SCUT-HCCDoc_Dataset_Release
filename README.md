# SCUT-HCTW_Dataset_Release

The SCUT-HCTW Dataset for the research of offline handwritten Chinese text recognition (HCTR) in 
camera-captured document images is now released by Deep Leaning and Visual Computing Lab of South 
China University of Technology. The dataset can be downloaded through the following link:

## Description

The SCUT-HCTW Dataset contains 12,253 camera-captured natural images with 116,629 text lines
and 1,155,801 characters. The following images are some examples of text lines of SCUT-HCTW.

SCUT-HCTW is divided into five subsets according to the image 
and text features. The comparison of the five subsets of SCUT-HCTW in 
terms of the character number and text line box number (ABN is average box number; 
ACN is average character number) is shown below.

The diversity of SCUT-HCTW can be described in three levels: 
1) **Image-level diversity:** image appearance and geometric variances
caused by camera-captured settings (such as perspective, background, and resolution) and 
different applications (such as note-taking, test papers, and homework); 
2) **Text-level diversity:** variances of text line length, rotation, etc.; 
3) **Character-level diversity:** variances of character categories (up to 6,109 classes 
with additional English letters, and digits), character size, individual writing style, etc.

For example, the following image shows the number of character instances for the 50 most frequently 
observed character categories in the SCUT-HCTW.
